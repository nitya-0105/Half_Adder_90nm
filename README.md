# Half_Adder_90nm
The Half Adder is a combinational circuit used to perform the addition of two single-bit binary numbers.
Features
- **Design**: Implementation using fundamental logic gates (AND, XOR).
- **Optimization**: Reduced area and improved delay.
- ## Truth Table
| A | B | Sum | Carry |
|---|---|-----|-------|
| 0 | 0 |  0  |   0   |
| 0 | 1 |  1  |   0   |
| 1 | 0 |  1  |   0   |
| 1 | 1 |  0  |   1   |


**Equation**
- Sum = A^B
- Carry = A.B
