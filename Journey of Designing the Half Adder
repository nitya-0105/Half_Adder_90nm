# Half Adder Design

## About Half Adder
The Half Adder is a combinational circuit used to perform the addition of two single-bit binary numbers. It outputs:

- **Sum**: XOR operation between inputs.
- **Carry**: AND operation between inputs.

This project takes a deep dive into designing a Half Adder with a focus on optimizing its performance and understanding CMOS design intricacies.

## Designing the Half Adder
Initially, the design was implemented using standard **AND** and **XOR gates**. While functionally correct, the initial design lacked optimization and aesthetic appeal in the layout.

To address these shortcomings:
- I chose a **customized approach** for the AND gate.
- Semi-custom design techniques were applied to the XOR gate.

This approach required delving into the foundational layers of CMOS design and an in-depth understanding of fabrication constraints.

## Optimization Process
Through a full-custom design approach, the optimization included:

- Learning about the **layers** in CMOS design: oxide, metal, n-implant, p-implant, and polysilicon.
- Understanding why **poly width** matters and how it impacts performance.
- Adjusting the **distance between layers** to minimize parasitic effects.
- Solving **Design Rule Check (DRC) errors**, ensuring the layout complies with manufacturing rules.

These adjustments significantly reduced the area and improved the design's overall efficiency.

## Challenges Faced
Designing a customized Half Adder wasnâ€™t without its hurdles:

### Learning Curve
- Understanding CMOS fabrication processes, such as the role of different layers and why specific design parameters are critical.

### Solving DRC Errors
- Custom designs often lead to rule violations. Fixing these errors was a challenging but rewarding experience, especially with mentor guidance.

### LVS Errors
- Layout versus Schematic (LVS) errors were frequent due to minor mismatches in the schematic and layout. Debugging these errors required patience and precision, but solving them was immensely satisfying.

## Outcomes and Learnings
- Successfully designed a **fully customized AND gate** and a **semi-customized XOR gate**.
- Developed a deep understanding of CMOS design rules, fabrication layers, and optimization techniques.
- Improved proficiency in handling **DRC** and **LVS** issues, ensuring a seamless design flow.

## Future Goals
- Extend this understanding to **Full Adder** and **Ripple Carry Adders**.
- Explore further **area and power optimization techniques**.
- Collaborate on more complex CMOS circuit designs.
